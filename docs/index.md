# Drupal Recipes Documentation

This site documents Drupal's recipes along with the configuration actions, checkpoints, default content services, and other subsystems that power them. Pages in the sidebar are generated automatically via `composer mk:docs`; edit the underlying PHP classes or recipe YAML files to update the content.
